# ronda
Ronda Schedule


# What is Ronda?
- This is not about Ronda Rousey, :D
- Ronda is the schedule of Neighborhood Security System (NSS), base on Indonesia's Siskamling (Sistim keamanan lingkungan), or we also call it ronda.
- This is an application to build schedule of NSS, to manage the participants of NSS when to do the duty of Ronda.
- Actually, this is my old coding file, I found it without maintenance, so I decide to upload it.


# Sample
